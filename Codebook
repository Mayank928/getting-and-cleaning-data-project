## Original Dataset
Collected from 30 individuals performing 6 activities (e.g., walking, sitting) with a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Variables in tidy_dataset.txt
Each row is the average of each variable for a subject/activity pair:
- `Subject`: Identifier for the individual
- `Activity`: One of WALKING, SITTING, etc.
- All other columns: sensor signals like TimeBodyAccelerometer-mean()-X

## Steps Taken:
1. Merged training and test datasets
2. Extracted mean and std measurements
3. Replaced activity codes with names
4. Cleaned variable names for readability
5. Grouped by subject/activity and calculated averages
